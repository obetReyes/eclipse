# ECLIPSE FRIST ALPHA RELEASE 

> Every user interaction generates data â€“ from a traffic stop to a suspect interview. In the past, a  police/guardians relied on a trusty notepad and pen. Today, police utilize devices such as police body-worn cameras, mobile data terminals, interview room cameras, and more. These devices are creating mountains of data, and because most of it is created digitally, the solution for managing it must also be digital.

eclipse creates an interface for users to easily upload their videos, incident reports, arrest records, and evidence documentation. This data is then stored digitally and can be shared among workstations or even across jurisdictions.
